	"A typical Squeak image contains about 80-90k methods with 250-350 characters per methods on average. Assuming OpenAI's ada-002 text embedding model, 1 character of Smalltalk sources averages to 0.26-0.3 tokens, the average document is 6224 bytes large per document, and a full image corpus will consume about 560 MB."
